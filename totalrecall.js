/* A.  ======Q & A=======
How do we assign a value to a variable? 
  A. With the assignment operator
How do we change the value of a variable?
  A. By using the let keyword
How do we assign an existing variable to a new variable?
  A. Use the = operator (let b = 10.....let a = b)
Remind me, what are declare, assign, and define?
  A. These are all ways to intiate things like variables in JS
What is pseudocoding and why should you do it?
  A. Pseudocoding is writing out your coding ideas in plain English to plan your coding project before you get started.
What percentage of time should be spent thinking about how you're going to solve a problem vs actually typing in code to solve it?
  A. You should spend about 90 percent of the time thinking about how to solve a problem. The remaining time should be spent coding.
